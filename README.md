Dungeons and Dragons Dice Program - V1 

The Dice app utilises If/Elif to determine the number sided Die the user wishes to roll. The random module is used in order appropriately select a random digit within the range selected by the user. 
In the event a string is submitted rather than an integer, the user receives an error message prompting an integer value be passed to the program. 
A message is set to display when the user rolls either a 20 or 1 when rolling the 20 sided die. 


 Future version will utilise Functions and then Classes in order to refine and remove repeated code.
