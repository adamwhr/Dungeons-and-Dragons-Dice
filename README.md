The Dice app utilises If/Elif to determine the number sided Die the user wishes to roll. In the event a string is submitted rather than an integer, the user receives an error message prompting an integer value be passed to the program. A message is set to display when the user rolls either a 20 or 1 when rolling the 20 sided die.
